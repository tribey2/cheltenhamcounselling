    <h2>Emotional Therapeutic Counselling</h2>
    <hr/>
    <img src="assets/images/chairs.jpg" class="img-responsive" id="etc-img1" alt="" />
    <p>Emotional Therapeutic Counselling is a person-centred, interactive and creative talking therapy which aims to help people who are suffering from any difficulties within their lives.</p>

    <p>Emotional Therapeutic Counselling can help people with a range of difficulties within their lives, which may include relationship problems, family issues, loss &amp; bereavement, work related issues such as bullying, financial worries, illness, parenting problems or unresolved emotional trauma from the near or distant past. You might feel depressed, suffer from anxiety, sad, angry, isolated, lacking in confidence, low self-esteem, stuck or unable to cope.</p>

    <p>As a counsellor, Sue will provide you with a safe and supportive environment within which you can be heard and emotionally supported. She will listen to you without judgement, and offer you the time and encouragement that you need in order to explore the difficulties present within your life. Throughout this process, Sue will help you to unravel, express and make sense of your feelings and emotions using gentle and effective therapeutic techniques.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/pencils.jpg" class="img-responsive"  id="etc-img2" alt="" />

    <p>Emotional Therapeutic Counselling can also focus on your journey beyond the counselling process. With this in mind, Sue also aims to help you improve your self-esteem and self-worth, and encourages you to look at the choices you have. This will empower you to create a more fulfilling and positive future.</p>

    <p>Sue has worked with a large number of people with varying and diverse needs, and during her time as a practising counsellor she has witnessed how the Emotional Therapeutic Counselling process has changed and transformed many peoples lives, and enabled them to take positive steps forward.</p>
